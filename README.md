## Description
This application let the user take part of a presentation, as the presenter of as a viewer.
The goal is to integrate a live feedback into a presentation. The audience can send private and public requests during
the "show", and the presenter is able to see them directly.

## Our concept
A user creates an account. He can be a presenter and a viewer. 
In the first case, he puts a PDF file, and indicates he's ready to present.
In the second case, he selects the user who will present, then the title of the presentation. He chooses it and starts the PDF.

## Users
- Viewer
- Presenter

- For the presenter :

	- Only slides for the projector
- Viewer screen (slides, requests, stats and chat).
- Presentation summary for past presentations : title, PDF file, description, date and stats (requests).
