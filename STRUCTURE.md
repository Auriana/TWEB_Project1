##1. <a name="description"></a>Quick description##

In order to develop the infrastructure of our application, we used [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io). Its workflow includes other technologies:
* [AngularJS]( https://angularjs.org), the JavaScript framework
* [Bower](), the management tool
* [Grunt](), the build tool

We chose the [AngularJS Full-Stack generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack), and selected several options, including:
* Client-side :
	* Scripts: JavaScript
	* Markup: Jade 
	* Stylesheets: Stylus
* Server-side :
	* Database: MongoDB 
	* Socket.io


##2. <a name="structure"></a>Files structure##

The file structure is defined by the Yeoman's skeleton. Here is the description of the main folders :

* client : the client side 
	* app : all the client application
	* account : landing page and login
	* admin : panel admin
	* main : home page
	* presenterSide : page for the presenter
    * viewerSide : page for the viewer
    * assets : all the images 
	
* dist : the final version to push on internet
    * public : client application
    * server : server application
	
* server : the server side 
    * api : all the endPoint 
    * auth : different authentication system (Facebook, ...)

* node_modules : library folder, used by Bower
	
Each model has an affiliated Stylus file. For example, the home page has its Style Sheet home.styl, and so on.


##3. <a name="db"></a>Data Base##

###3.1 MongoDB###

To save the data, we use the NoSQL database MongoDB. It uses a collection system instead of the classic tables in a relation database.

###3.2 Entities###

For Dimmi, we have 3 endpoints : 

  * message : message and requests in the chat for each lecture.
  
  * presentation : lecture information.
  
  * user : user information.

###3.3 REST API###

When it is necessary to do a query in the database, we use the `$http` object from Angular. That allows us to do HTTP request to the REST API.

In order to create the API in our skeleton, the template provides us a method called `yo angular-fullstack:endpoint $ENDPOINT_NAME$`. 
This method creates the entire file in the `/server/api`folder with the default CRUD operators.

When we create a endpoint (or entity), a new folder is created, which contains all the necessary files. Here are the description of those files :

* index.js : contains all the REST route that we can use for interactions with Mongo.
* controller.js : contains the functions which are called by index.js. By default, there is a CRUD operation.
* model.js : contains the structure of our collection in MongoDB.
* socket.js : contains some functions used by SocketIO, for exemple to broadcast a new entry.
* spec.js : defines the I/O of the REST service.
  
 ###3.4 Adding a route### 
 
Sometime, we had to add a more specific route for our API. To do that, the first thing to do was to add a new route in
the index.js file. After that, it was possible to create a specific function in the controller and link it to the route. Then we wrote the query.
In the client side, we have to use `$http` to send REST request, for example `$http().get().success()`.

	
##4. <a name="details"></a>Implementation details##

###4.1 $scope###

The `$scope` variable represents the environment of the current application. This means that when we want to create a variable in the app, 
we have to create it through the `$scope`. In this way, it's possible to use it in the different views (jade , ...).

###4.2 Passing from home page to presenter/viewer sides### 

Generally, to change the page automatically, we use the javascript propriety `window.location`. Besides, it's a bit more complicated when passing from home page to presenter/viewer sides. It is indeed necessary to keep the information of the presentation. To do that, we put the presentation's id into the URL. The callback function checks if the previous call was successful, validates the form, loads the PDF file, and finally switches the page.


##5. <a name="loading"></a>PDF loading and displaying##

The two main purposes of this application are the following:
-	For the presenter : to upload the PDF file.
-	For the viewer : to display the PDF file.

In order to implement them, we used an existing library: [PDF.js](http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js). But it was more complicated to add the provided features to our application, because of our specific infrastructure. We had to add the javascript code (from the library) to the controllers of the presenterSide and the viewerSide pages (`client/app/presenterSide.controller.js` and `client/app/viewerSide.controller.js`). Then, it was necessary to include in another way the generated `pdf.worker.js` file: so that Bower does not insclude it in its generated files, we had to write the following code slightly below the other automatic script includes.

```
<script type="application/javascript">
  PDFJS.workerSrc = 'bower_components/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.js';
</script>`

```

Plus, we had to change several parameters from the initial code. For example, `function onPrevPage() {...}` became `$ $scope.onPrevPage = function () {...]`inorder this function could be called by the button linked to this action. 

       /*
        var renderContext = {
          canvasContext: context,
          viewport: viewport
        };
        page.render(renderContext);
        */
        renderPage(1);


##6. <a name="hosting"></a>PDF hosting##

With the use of Heroku and the fact that many PDF files could be uploaded on it, we had to find a solution to host these files. We use the Amazon Web Services, the S3 platform in particular.

###6.1 Amazon S3###

In order to configure S3 with our application, we followed this tutorial : [http://www.cheynewallace.com/uploading-to-s3-with-angularjs](http://www.cheynewallace.com/uploading-to-s3-with-angularjs). But we still had to have the right configuration. This is showed after.
	
###6.2 Configurations###

For the context of Dimmi application, we needed to fix some parameters. Here are our configuration settings :

<img src="https://github.com/Auriana/TWEB_Project1/blob/master/doc-img/s3Config.PNG" alt="Config S3" title="Config S3" align="center" />

And the `CORSRule` :

```
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
      <CORSRule>
          <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
          <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
          <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
          <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
          <ExposeHeader>x-amz-server-side-encryption</ExposeHeader>
          <ExposeHeader>x-amz-request-id</ExposeHeader>
          <ExposeHeader>x-amz-id-2</ExposeHeader>

          <ExposeHeader>Content-Range</ExposeHeader>

      </CORSRule>
  </CORSConfiguration>

```

##7. <a name="landing"></a>Landing Page##

The template of the landing page comes from http://www.blacktie.co/2013/12/flatty-app-landing-page. We especially have been inspired by the structure of the page. Indeed, we change the other aspects in order that the design and the content match with Dimmiâ€™s concept, and its current state. This page is implemented in the client/app/account/home.jade file.
